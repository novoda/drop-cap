# DropCap [![](https://ci.novoda.com/buildStatus/icon?job=drop-cap)](https://ci.novoda.com/job/drop-cap/lastBuild/console) [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/novoda/maven/drop-cap/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/novoda/maven/drop-cap/_latestVersion) [![Apache 2.0 Licence](https://img.shields.io/github/license/novoda/drop-cap.svg)](https://github.com/novoda/drop-cap/blob/master/LICENSE)

This library can be used to create a DropCap in your app! A DropCap is the first letter of a paragraph that's of a much
bigger size than the rest that follow. The formatting is such that the DropCap spans (drops down) to cover the few lines
following the first.

If there are not enough lines to wrap the `DropCap` then the style on the first character will default to the style
of the copy text. This styling is to keep the text consist when a `DropCap` is not present.

This feature was added to handle the case in which the `DropCap` is immediately preceded by a quotation mark.
![drop_cap_too_many](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3380092/24722530/edcf912c-1a3b-11e7-8757-d336c8bd3c95.png) | In the event that the `numberOfDropCaps` is too large to accommodate any copy text immediately after the `DropCap`, the library will remove the `DropCap` capability and default to copy only.
![not_enough_text](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3380092/20004465/6385c7d6-a284-11e6-875e-b1647968865b.png) | In the event that not enough text is supplied to completely wrap a `DropCap`, the library will remove the `DropCap` and default to copy only.

## Adding to your project

To start using this library, add these lines to the `build.gradle` of your project:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.novoda:drop-cap:<latest-version>'
}
```

## Simple usage

Simply add `DropCapView` to one of your layout xml files and use the following xml attributes for customization.

```
    <attr name="numberOfDropCaps" format=“integer” />	
    <attr name="lineSpacingExtra" format="dimension" />
    <attr name="dropCapTextSize" format="dimension" />
    <attr name="dropCapTextColor" format="color" />
    <attr name="dropCapFontPath" format="string" />

    <attr name="copyTextSize" format="dimension" />
    <attr name="copyTextColor" format="color" />
    <attr name="copyFontPath" format="string" />

    <attr name="android:text" />
```

For ease of use, the `DropCapView` uses the `android:text` attribute to specify text via the xml layout.
